# repair_dashboard
A repair ticket management dashboard programmed in python with Flask

This program works in conjunction with a mariadb database, the login info, 
structure, and contents of which I am not sharing for security reasons.

The dashboard provides you with functionalities to sign in, create, and 
edit tickets as well as search the database.

The code linked here contains only the contributions that I have made,
another employee is in charge of styling and "making it pretty," though 
all functionalities are present here.
